# _printf()
The printf project is a collaboration project by **Muhyideen Elias** and **Mavel Antwi**,
The project focus on reimplementing the standard printf() function in stdio.h as _printf(). 
The _printf() function enables the programmer to display the output or some information on
the console or interface directly just as standard printf().

_printf() prototype is as follows:
```
int _printf(const char *format, ...)
```

As the standard printf() is a variadic function so as _printf(), it receives N number of arguments that is replaced by
N number of tags inside the string.
